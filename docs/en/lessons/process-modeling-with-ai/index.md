# Process Modeling With AI

<div class="lesson-meta">
  <span>AI-Augmented BA Workflow</span>
  <span>Software BA</span>
  <span>Core</span>
</div>

## Learning outcomes

- Explain process modeling with ai in business language.
- Apply the concept to a realistic BA workflow.
- Use AI output as draft evidence, not as unchecked truth.
- Identify the review questions a BA must ask before sharing the artifact.

## Why this matters for BA work

AI changes how analysis work is produced, but it does not remove the BA's accountability for clarity, evidence, and decisions.

## Core concept

The useful BA pattern is controlled collaboration: provide the model with business context, ask for structured output, require evidence, then review the result against goals, rules, risks, and stakeholder decisions.

## Practical BA example

For onboarding, AI drafts a happy path. The BA then forces it to add rejection, missing document, duplicate account, SLA breach, and manual override paths.

```

## BA workflow

1. Frame the business question before opening the AI tool.
2. Provide source context and explicit constraints.
3. Ask for structured output that maps back to the source.
4. Run a critique pass for ambiguity, gaps, risk, and testability.
5. Convert the result into an artifact the team can inspect and own.

## Prompt or template

```text
Create a process model with actors, steps, decision points, exceptions, SLAs, inputs, outputs, and unresolved policy questions. Use Mermaid syntax.
```

## What a BA should remember

- AI is a reasoning accelerator, not a decision owner.
- Ground every important claim in source context or stakeholder confirmation.
- A good BA keeps the review loop visible: draft, critique, revise, validate.
