# Diagramming for BA

<div class="lesson-meta">

## Learning outcomes

- Explain diagramming for ba in business language.
- Apply the concept to a realistic BA workflow.
- Use AI output as draft evidence, not as unchecked truth.
- Identify the review questions a BA must ask before sharing the artifact.

## Why this matters for BA work

AI changes how analysis work is produced, but it does not remove the BA's accountability for clarity, evidence, and decisions.

## Core concept

The useful BA pattern is controlled collaboration: provide the model with business context, ask for structured output, require evidence, then review the result against goals, rules, risks, and stakeholder decisions.

## Practical BA example

A BA uses AI to turn text requirements into a sequence diagram, then reviews actor responsibility, system boundary, failure path, and missing integration.

## Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Business goal"] --> B["Source context"]
    B --> C["AI analysis"]
    C --> D{"BA review"}
    D -->|"Revise"| B
    D -->|"Approve"| E["Validated artifact"]
    E --> F["Diagramming for BA"]
```

## BA workflow

1. Frame the business question before opening the AI tool.
2. Provide source context and explicit constraints.
3. Ask for structured output that maps back to the source.
4. Run a critique pass for ambiguity, gaps, risk, and testability.
5. Convert the result into an artifact the team can inspect and own.

## Prompt or template

```text
Convert this requirement into a Mermaid flowchart and sequence diagram. Then list assumptions, missing steps, and business decisions that affect the diagram.
```

## What a BA should remember

- AI is a reasoning accelerator, not a decision owner.
- Ground every important claim in source context or stakeholder confirmation.
- A good BA keeps the review loop visible: draft, critique, revise, validate.
