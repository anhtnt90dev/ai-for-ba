# Traceability and Testability

<div class="lesson-meta">
  <span>Requirements Engineering With AI</span>

## Learning outcomes

- Explain traceability and testability in business language.
- Apply the concept to a realistic BA workflow.
- Use AI output as draft evidence, not as unchecked truth.
- Identify the review questions a BA must ask before sharing the artifact.

## Why this matters for BA work

AI changes how analysis work is produced, but it does not remove the BA's accountability for clarity, evidence, and decisions.

Connect business goals to requirements, acceptance criteria, test scenarios, and release decisions.

## Core concept

The useful BA pattern is controlled collaboration: provide the model with business context, ask for structured output, require evidence, then review the result against goals, rules, risks, and stakeholder decisions.

## Practical BA example

A release has 80 stories but no clear mapping to business outcomes. The BA uses AI to build a traceability matrix and identify orphan requirements.

```

## BA workflow

1. Frame the business question before opening the AI tool.
2. Provide source context and explicit constraints.
3. Ask for structured output that maps back to the source.
4. Run a critique pass for ambiguity, gaps, risk, and testability.
5. Convert the result into an artifact the team can inspect and own.

## Prompt or template

```text
Create a traceability matrix linking business objective, stakeholder need, requirement, acceptance criteria, test scenario, metric, and source evidence.
```

## What a BA should remember

- AI is a reasoning accelerator, not a decision owner.
- Ground every important claim in source context or stakeholder confirmation.
- A good BA keeps the review loop visible: draft, critique, revise, validate.
