# Specifying AI-Enabled Features

<div class="lesson-meta">
  <span>Building AI-Enabled Products as a BA</span>
  <span>Software BA</span>
  <span>Core</span>
</div>

## Learning outcomes

- Explain specifying ai-enabled features in business language.
- Apply the concept to a realistic BA workflow.
- Use AI output as draft evidence, not as unchecked truth.
- Identify the review questions a BA must ask before sharing the artifact.

## Why this matters for BA work

AI changes how analysis work is produced, but it does not remove the BA's accountability for clarity, evidence, and decisions.

Write requirements for AI features that are probabilistic, data-dependent, and quality-sensitive.

## Core concept

The useful BA pattern is controlled collaboration: provide the model with business context, ask for structured output, require evidence, then review the result against goals, rules, risks, and stakeholder decisions.

## Practical BA example

A team wants an AI triage assistant. The BA specifies input sources, output classes, confidence threshold, escalation path, user correction, audit, and quality metrics.

```

## BA workflow

1. Frame the business question before opening the AI tool.
2. Provide source context and explicit constraints.
3. Ask for structured output that maps back to the source.
4. Run a critique pass for ambiguity, gaps, risk, and testability.
5. Convert the result into an artifact the team can inspect and own.

## Prompt or template

```text
Specify this AI feature with user goal, model task, input data, output contract, confidence threshold, human review, fallback, safety constraints, and evaluation metrics.
```

## What a BA should remember

- AI is a reasoning accelerator, not a decision owner.
- Ground every important claim in source context or stakeholder confirmation.
- A good BA keeps the review loop visible: draft, critique, revise, validate.
